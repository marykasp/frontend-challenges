## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

Practiced more using grid to center the columns in the flexbox layout.

Also used margin-left on icon in card in order to move it to the left (image needs to be block scoped for this to work)

```css
img {
  display: block;
}

.card img {
  margin-left: auto;
}
```
